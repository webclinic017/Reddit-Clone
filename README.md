## Reddit Clone
Project Status: In-Progress

# Project Description
This project is a clone of the popular site Reddit. This project is
being built using a microservices architecture where each service is its
own Python Flask App. The services will be containerized and deployed on
AWS using terraform as an Infrastructure as Code(IAC) tool. The frontend
of the project is being implemented as a React-TypeScript application.
